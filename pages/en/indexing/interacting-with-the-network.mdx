title: Interacting with the network

### Stake in the protocol

The first steps to participating in the network as an Indexer are to approve the protocol, stake funds, and (optionally) set up an operator address for day-to-day protocol interactions. _ **Note**: For the purposes of these instructions Remix will be used for contract interaction, but feel free to use your tool of choice ([OneClickDapp](https://oneclickdapp.com/), [ABItopic](https://abitopic.io/), and [MyCrypto](https://www.mycrypto.com/account) are a few other known tools)._

Once an Indexer has staked GRT in the protocol, the [Indexer components](/network/indexing#indexer-components) can be started up and begin their interactions with the network.

#### Approve tokens

1. Open the [Remix app](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in a browser

2. In the `File Explorer` create a file named **GraphToken.abi** with the [token ABI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphprotocol/contracts/mainnet-deploy-build/build/abis/GraphToken.json).

3. With `GraphToken.abi` selected and open in the editor, switch to the Deploy and `Run Transactions` section in the Remix interface.

4. Under environment select `Injected Web3` and under `Account` select your Indexer address.

5. Set the GraphToken contract address - Paste the GraphToken contract address (`0xc944E90C64B2c07662A292be6244BDf05Cda44a7`) next to `At Address` and click the `At address` button to apply.

6. Call the `approve(spender, amount)` function to approve the Staking contract. Fill in `spender` with the Staking contract address (`0xF55041E37E12cD407ad00CE2910B8269B01263b9`) and `amount` with the tokens to stake (in wei).

#### Stake tokens

1. Open the [Remix app](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in a browser

2. In the `File Explorer` create a file named **Staking.abi** with the staking ABI.

3. With `Staking.abi` selected and open in the editor, switch to the `Deploy` and `Run Transactions` section in the Remix interface.

4. Under environment select `Injected Web3` and under `Account` select your Indexer address.

5. Set the Staking contract address - Paste the Staking contract address (`0xF55041E37E12cD407ad00CE2910B8269B01263b9`) next to `At Address` and click the `At address` button to apply.

6. Call `stake()` to stake GRT in the protocol.

7. (Optional) Indexers may approve another address to be the operator for their Indexer infrastructure in order to separate the keys that control the funds from those that are performing day to day actions such as allocating on subgraphs and serving (paid) queries. In order to set the operator call `setOperator()` with the operator address.

8. (Optional) In order to control the distribution of rewards and strategically attract Delegators Indexers can update their delegation parameters by updating their indexingRewardCut (parts per million), queryFeeCut (parts per million), and cooldownBlocks (number of blocks). To do so call `setDelegationParameters()`. The following example sets the queryFeeCut to distribute 95% of query rebates to the Indexer and 5% to Delegators, set the indexingRewardCutto distribute 60% of indexing rewards to the Indexer and 40% to Delegators, and set `thecooldownBlocks` period to 500 blocks.

```
setDelegationParameters(950000, 600000, 500)
```

### The life of an allocation

After being created by an Indexer a healthy allocation goes through four states.

- **Active** - Once an allocation is created on-chain ([allocateFrom()](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/master/contracts/staking/Staking.sol#L873)) it is considered **active**. A portion of the Indexer's own and/or delegated stake is allocated towards a subgraph deployment, which allows them to claim indexing rewards and serve queries for that subgraph deployment. The Indexer agent manages creating allocations based on the Indexer rules.

- **Closed** - An Indexer is free to close an allocation once 1 epoch has passed ([closeAllocation()](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/master/contracts/staking/Staking.sol#L873)) or their Indexer agent will automatically close the allocation after the **maxAllocationEpochs** (currently 28 days). When an allocation is closed with a valid proof of indexing (POI) their indexing rewards are distributed to the Indexer and its Delegators (see "how are rewards distributed?" below to learn more).

- **Finalized** - Once an allocation has been closed there is a dispute period after which the allocation is considered **finalized** and it's query fee rebates are available to be claimed (claim()). The Indexer agent monitors the network to detect **finalized** allocations and claims them if they are above a configurable (and optional) threshold, **â€”-allocation-claim-threshold**.

- **Claimed** - The final state of an allocation; it has run its course as an active allocation, all eligible rewards have been distributed and its query fee rebates have been claimed.
