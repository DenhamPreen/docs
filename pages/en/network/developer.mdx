Developers are a core part of The Graph ecosystem. They’re building and querying subgraphs making high-quality data available to users through simple interfaces.

Anyone can build and deploy a subgraph that queries data from a specific part of the blockchain.

Once a subgraph has been deployed to the decentralized network, developers can begin making queries to it using GRT. Subgraphs are available to anyone to query data.

There are 5 steps to a subgraph’s lifecycle.

## Developing

The Graph CLI tool streamlines the process of creating a subgraph. When you initialize your subgraph, all the default files will be created and configured.

When writing your subgraph mappings, you can use the built-APIs or add other libraries as dependencies as long as they are compatible with AssemblyScript.

Developers can use Matchstick, a unit testing framework, to test the mapping logic in a sandboxed environment to deploy their subgraph with confidence.

## Deploying

The Subgraph Studio is where you’ll build, add metadata to, and publish your subgraph to the decentralized network. In the Subgraph Studio, you have full control over your subgraphs. You can test them or restrict access with your API keys.

Anyone can sign in to Subgraph Studio using their wallet via MetaMask or WalletConnect.

## Publishing

Once your subgraph is deployed, it's ready to be published to the decentralized network.

This is where Curators will be able to curating your subgraph and Indexers can begin indexing it. The metadata can be modified at any time using the Subgraph Studio dashboard.

## Managing

Subgraph ownership is determined by an NFT based on the ERC-721 standard. Whoever owns the NFT controls the subgraph.

You can also deprecate your subgraph at any time. This will remove it from The Graph Explorer. Curators will not be able to signal on it anymore, and existing Curators can withdraw their signal at an average share price.

## Querying

Anyone can query an existing subgraph by using The Graph Explorer and opening a GraphiQL interface. This will enable them to explore the subgraph by issuing queries and viewing the schema.

Querying subgraphs using your API keys will generate query fees that will be paid in GRT.
